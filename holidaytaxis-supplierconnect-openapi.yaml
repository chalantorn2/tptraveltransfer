        # Basic Usage
        In order to reconfirm multiple bookings, the following url must be used via a POST request:


        > HTTP POST: /bookings/reconfirm
  
        # Request Details
        The details to be updated must be included as the **RAW POST DATA**  in either XML or JSON.
      
        You can update any of the below details of a booking:
        
        # Pick-up time
        A booking's pick-up time (in local timezone) can be confirmed or updated. The default pickup time on bookings is based on the estimated travel time to the destination and the check-in time required at the destination airport, port, train station, etc. (if applicable).
        
        It is **highly recommended** that the pick-up time is reviewed on ALL bookings to ensure all passengers get to their destination in plenty of time.
        
        # Name and Address of Pick-up Accommodation
        The name and address of a booking's pick-up accommodation can be updated if they are different from the details currently on the booking.

      summary: Provide driver and vehicle details for a booking
      tags:
        - driver-events
      description: |-
        This request allows the supplier to provide information about the driver(s) and vehicle(s) assigned to a booking.
        Holiday Taxis will then share this directly with the customer, so that they can contact or locate the driver
        at the pickup point.
        
        Details of how this will be communicated to the customer are subject to change, and suppliers are encouraged
        to supply as much information as they have available to avoid needing later changes as recommendations evolve.
        
        Please inform [spm@holidaytaxis.com](mailto:spm@holidaytaxis.com) if you are planning to start sending any Driver Events data.
        
        This request should normally be sent once per vehicle per booking.
        
        It is requested that details are provided in English where applicable, e.g. for the "color" and "description" fields.
        
        Please also see the [Driver events booking flow](/supplier-connect/booking-flow.html)
        ### Vehicle Identifiers
        
        The `vehicleIdentifier` allows the system to distinguish between multiple vehicles fulfilling one booking,
        and to link the contact, vehicle, status, and location for that vehicle.
        
        The identifier for each physical vehicle or driver should be unique within a booking, but does not need to be
        consistent between bookings.
        
        Integrators are free to use any identifier that is convenient, subject to the following constraints:
        
        - Each identifier must be no longer than 40 characters.
        - Each identifier must contain only characters unreserved in URIs (as defined by RFC 3986): uppercase and lowercase
          letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde.
        
        Integrators must store (or be able to predictably regenerate) this vehicleIdentifier in their system for future requests.
        
        Examples of identifiers which could be used:
        
        - A number incremented within the booking for each vehicle added or replaced, e.g. `/bookings/HTX-12345678/vehicles/3`
        - An internal identifier for the vehicle or transfer from a fleet management system, e.g. `/bookings/HTX-12345678/vehicles/to_pr_jo_03`
          or `/bookings/HTX-12345678/vehicles/bc9f89ab-285f-410e-913e-464d4adbaa53`
        - The registration plate of the vehicle, e.g. `/bookings/HTX-12345678/vehicles/AB-123-XYZ`
        - The driver's internal username, e.g. `/bookings/HTX-12345678/vehicles/j.smith`
        - A hash of an identifier which you do not want to expose, or which would not meet the length and character requirements,
          e.g. calculate `sha_256('minnie.driver@example.com')` and shorten to `/bookings/HTX-12345678/vehicles/81c35bb182ed10e371b0`
        
        Within a booking, the number of distinct vehicle identifiers in use must not exceed the number of vehicles
        requested by the customer (as indicated by `novehicles` when retrieving the booking information).
        If a replacement vehicle is allocated to the booking, a `DELETE /bookings/{bookingRef}/vehicles/{vehicleIdentifier}`
        request should be sent, and the new vehicle should be given a new identifier.
        
        Additional requests for the same vehicle identifier on the same booking will overwrite all previous values, even if a field is omitted or null
        in the new request. For example, if no driver name is provided in the request, any previous driver name for that
        vehicle on that booking will be deleted.

      summary: De-allocate a vehicle and driver from a booking
      tags:
        - driver-events
      description: |-
        As described under `PUT /bookings/{bookingRef}/vehicles/{vehicleIdentifier}`, a vehicle identifier is associated
        with all vehicle, driver, status, and location information, to distinguish multiple vehicles fulfilling one booking.
        
        If a change in circumstances means that a new vehicle is being allocated to the booking, this operation can be used
        to indicate that information associated with a vehicle identifier is no longer applicable.
        The replacement vehicle can then be allocated by sending a new vehicle identifier in a
        `PUT /bookings/{bookingRef}/vehicles/{vehicleIdentifier}` or
        `POST /bookings/{bookingRef}/vehicles/{vehicleIdentifier}/location` request.
        
        Please inform [spm@holidaytaxis.com](mailto:spm@holidaytaxis.com) if you are planning to start sending any Driver Events data.
        
        No information for a de-allocated vehicle will be shown to the customer, but some anonymised history may be retained
        for use in later investigations, in line with the Holiday Taxis data protection policy.
        
        Note that it is only necessary to de-allocate vehicles from future or in progress bookings. Once a booking has 
        been completed, the information will no longer be shown to the customer, and will be automatically deleted or 
        anonymised in line with the Holiday Taxis data protection policy.

      summary: Provide current location of a vehicle
      tags:
        - driver-events
      description: |-
        This operation is used to provide live status and location information, which will be shared with the customer,
        and may be stored for use in later enquiries.
        
        Each request must include either a status, a location, or both.
        
        Please inform [spm@holidaytaxis.com](mailto:spm@holidaytaxis.com) if you are planning to start sending any Driver Events data.
        
        If available, a new status should be sent when the driver arrives at the pickup point (WAITING_FOR_CUSTOMER),
        once the customer is on board (AFTER_PICKUP), and once the customer has been dropped off (COMPLETED).
        
        If available, a new location should be sent every 5 seconds until the transfer is completed. However, if this
        update frequency is not possible, you must provide a location at least every 60 seconds.
        Each request may include a status, even if it has not changed; if the status is not provided, it is assumed
        that the last status sent is still accurate.
        
        The `vehicleIdentifier` must be used to distinguish status and location information when a booking is fulfilled
        by multiple vehicles (as indicated by `novehicles` when retrieving the booking information). For details, see
        the description of `PUT /bookings/{bookingRef}/vehicles/{vehicleIdentifier}`.
        
        It is not required to send a `PUT /bookings/{bookingRef}/vehicles/{vehicleIdentifier}` request before sending
        status or location information, but the `vehicleIdentifier` values used must be consistent across both operations.
        
        Please also see the [Driver events booking flow](/supplier-connect/booking-flow.html)

      summary: De-allocate all vehicles and drivers from a booking
      tags:
        - driver-events
      description: |-
        As described under `PUT /bookings/{bookingRef}/vehicles/{vehicleIdentifier}`, a vehicle identifier is associated
        with all vehicle, driver, status, and location information, to distinguish multiple vehicles fulfilling one booking.
        This identifier must then be re-used to update details, or "de-allocated" from the booking by calling 
        `DELETE /bookings/{bookingRef}/vehicles/{vehicleIdentifier}`
        
        In some situations, it may be necessary or convenient to de-allocate all vehicles from a booking in a single call.
        For example, the original vehicle identifier used may have been lost, and a new set of data needs to be provided.
        
        In this case, a `DELETE /bookings/{bookingRef}/vehicles` request (with no vehicle identifier) may be used. This
        has the same effect as calling `DELETE /bookings/{bookingRef}/vehicles/{vehicleIdentifier}` for each vehicle
        identifier previously used on that booking: no information previously sent will be shown to the customer, 
        but some anonymised history may be retained for use in later investigations, in line with the Holiday Taxis 
        data protection policy.
        
        Note that it is only necessary to de-allocate vehicles from future or in progress bookings. Once a booking has 
        been completed, the information will no longer be shown to the customer, and will be automatically deleted or 
        anonymised in line with the Holiday Taxis data protection policy.
        
        Please inform [spm@holidaytaxis.com](mailto:spm@holidaytaxis.com) if you are planning to start sending any Driver Events data.
        
        ### Example flow: Re-allocating both drivers/vehicles in a two-vehicle booking
        
        ```
        PUT /bookings/HTX-12345678/vehicles/jo_03
        { "driver": { "name": "Joe", "phoneNumber": "+4401111222333" } }
        PUT /bookings/HTX-12345678/vehicles/sa_07
        { "driver": { "name": "Sam", "phoneNumber": "+4401111444555" } }
        ...
        DELETE /bookings/HTX-12345678/vehicles
        PUT /bookings/HTX-12345678/vehicles/al_01
        { "driver": { "name": "Alex", "phoneNumber": "+4401111666777" } }
        PUT /bookings/HTX-12345678/vehicles/na_01
        { "driver": { "name": "Nathalie", "phoneNumber": "+4401111888999" } }
        ```
        
        De-allocating each vehicle in turn has exactly the same result:
        
        ```
        PUT /bookings/HTX-12345678/vehicles/jo_03
        { "driver": { "name": "Joe", "phoneNumber": "+4401111222333" } }
